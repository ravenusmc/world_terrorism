#World Terrorism
###Intro

This project is another project looking at terrorism however this time I have data from all over the world. I got a lot of this data from the website Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/argolof/predicting-terrorism. Looking over the data, I do not believe that it focuses on simply Terrorism but instead Islamic Terrorism. Not Exactly what I wanted-I want data from global Terrorist attacks since about 1970. However, this project will help me to continue to improve my skills with Pandas as well as looking at a topic I care a lot about in International Relations. 

#Getting started
